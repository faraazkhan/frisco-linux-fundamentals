A registry is a service for storing and accessing Docker images.

You'll learn how to:

- run a local registry in a container and configure your Docker engine to use the registry;

- generate SSL certificates (using Docker!) and run a secure local registry with a friendly domain name;

- generate encrypted passwords (using Docker!) and run an authenticated, secure local registry over HTTPS with basic auth.
